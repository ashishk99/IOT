		Hello folks, if you are on this page than you already know the importance on IOT in todays worlds. Many enthisiasits already know what IOT is but what they dont know is the ways to immplement it. so I am gonna tell you one of the simplest way to implement IOT using your voice command.
		so in this tutorial we will be working on to control your hardware with your google assistant.
		so lets get started.
	</p>
	<p>pre-requisites :</p> 
<ol>
	<li>Arduino IDE</li>
	<li>nodeMCU</li>
	<li>sajbcsaj</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p id="nodemcu">
You need to follow the following steps.
</p>
	<ol>
		<li>open Aruino IDE. go to files and select preferences.</li>
		<li>paste the link given below in the additional board manager URLs and click OK.</li>
		<a href="http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json">http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json</a>
		<li>now go to tools > boards and select "nodeMCU 1.0".</li>
	</ol>
<p>Now you are all set to code nodeMCU in arduino IDE.</p> 

<p id="adafruit">let's see how do we create a button which will control our application.</p> 

<ol>
	<li>go to adafruit.io an create an account for yourself. it is recommended that you use a single google account throughout this tutorial.</li>
	<li>on adafruit website click on "get started for free" on the top right corner.</li>
	<li>after creating the account on adafruit.io close that tab and open same site in the new tab. now you'll be automatically logged in.</li>
	<li>Now go to dashboard > view all > actions > "Create a new dashboard".</li>
	<li>give whatever name you want for eg : "myFirst IOT" and write a discription.</li>
	<li>now click on the dashboard that you just created, in the right most part of the window there is a blue + icon. that's for creating a new block.</li>
	<li>create a new block and add the toggle button, enter the feed name and click on create. now check the newly created feed and click next step.</li>
	<li>on the "button on text" replece "on" with "1" and on the "button off text" replece "off" with "0".
click on create block.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now you are all done with adafruit.io.</p> 
<p>now we should see how to put your google assistant to do your work.</p>

<ol id="ifttt">
	<li>go to ifttt.com and create an account with the same email-id.</li>
	<li>On the top right corner click on on your account and click on create.</li>
	<li>now you'll be able to see the "If this then that", there click on the "+" icon and select "google assistance" > "say a simple phrase"</li>
	<li>Type whatever you want to say to your assistance and create the trigger.</li>
	<li>now click on the "+" icon on "that" and select adafruit > send data to adafruit io</li>
	<li>Select feed name and data to be send should be "0" or "1" whatever you put on adafriut iot2 while creating button. after that create action.</li>
</ol>
<P>Now you are all set. you can ask your assistant to turn on or off the button you created on adafruit.io</P>
<p>Now we just need that button value to be uploaded to the device that we want to control</p>
